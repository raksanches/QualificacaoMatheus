abstract = "In this work, we propose a position-based finite element formulation for incompressible Newtonian flows under total Lagrangian description. Such formulation is different from the traditional finite element approach used in fluid dynamics by using current nodal positions as main variable instead of nodal velocities. The variational form of the governing equations is derived by applying the stationary total mechanical energy principle written in terms of current positions. To introduce full incompressibility, we use equal-order mixed finite elements combined to a pressure stabilizing Petrov-Galerkin technique, circumventing Ladyzhenskaya-Babu≈°ka-Brezzi conditions. This leads to a method directly applicable to finite strain incompressible flow problems that, if combined to re-meshing techniques, is capable of simulating more complex problems, resulting into a suitable tool for free-surface flows analysis in general. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach is demonstrated with numerical studies and comparison of obtained results to numerical and experimental data from literature."

  abstract = {Industrial forming processes are usually characterized by large plastic strains and rotations of material elements. This emphasizes the importance of reliable finite strain elastoplasticity models in corresponding finite element simulations. The aim of this work is to review and numerically compare two inherently different types of formulations of finite strain elastoplasticity, namely hypoelastic- and hyperelastic-based plasticity models, with special reference to their applicability in forming processes. Both models allow for nonlinear isotropic and kinematic hardening of Voce and Armstrong‚ÄìFrederick type and were implemented as user material subroutines (UMAT) into ABAQUS/Standard. Several numerical tests were conducted to assess their respective capabilities. Interestingly enough, although both models led to remarkably different results in shear-dominated single element deformation tests, the structural simulations of a deep drawing, draw bending and thermoforming process delivered nearly congruent results. This suggests that both models are well-suited for modeling elastoplastic materials in common industrial forming processes.}

In this method the standard finite element basis is enriched with a discontinuity in the derivative of the temperature normal to the interface. The approximation can then represent the phase interface and the associated discontinuity in the temperature gradient within an element. The phase interface can be evolved without re-meshing or the use of artificial heat capacity techniques. The interface is described by a level set function that is updated by a stabilized finite element scheme. Several examples are solved by the proposed method to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the method. Copyright ¬© 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}

The developed frame elements have cross sections constituted by laminas of different materials and widths. The Reissner-Mindlin kinematics is adopted to include shear effects into the formulation. These elements are connected among each other by semi-rigid connections. Both elements and connections have multi-linear elastoplastic behavior with isotropic hardening. An alternative flow direction rule, which allows the reproduction of any stress-strain curve and the determination of closed solution for the plastic multiplier, is shown. All steps to reproduce the formulation are provided. Various examples are used to demonstrate the good behavior of the formulation, including a progressive collapse analysis of a tall building subjected to a real seismic load. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {In this work, we propose a new enhancement strategy that can be applied to the calculated strain field in the analyses of shells by the unconstrained-vector finite element approach, a Solid-Shell-like formulation. This new enhancement is proposed to satisfy the continuity of the shear and normal stresses fields in the transverse direction. The kinematic enhancement is based on the in-plane longitudinal stress equilibrium that is associated with maintaining the elastic strain energy potential in the transverse direction of the shell or plate. No additional degrees of freedom are introduced, and a coherent continuous stress distribution is achieved from the enhanced strain field. Moreover, in contrast to typical elastoplastic procedures, we propose an alternative plastic flow rule, which includes a new concept of the hardening parameter that depends on the orthotropic directions of the material and a general failure surface that degenerates into the von-Mises or Drucker-Prager criteria for isotropic materials. The resulting alternative position-based finite element and the enhanced field strategies are tested for elastic and elastoplastic situations by comparing the results with other solutions and known benchmarks.},

A partitioned quasi-Newton technique which solves the coupled problem through nonlinear equations corresponding to the interface position is presented and its performance is compared with a monolithic Newton algorithm. Various structural configurations with an incompressible fluid are solved, and the ratio of the time for the partitioned simulation, when convergence is reached, to the time for the monolithic simulation is found to be between 1/2 and 4. However, in this comparison of the partitioned and monolithic simulations, the flow and structural equations have been solved with a direct sparse solver in full Newton‚ÄìRaphson iterations, only relatively small problems have been solved and this ratio would likely change if large industrial problems were considered or if other solution strategies were used."

The first formulation introduces the contact constraints via Lagrange multipliers, the other employs the penalty method. Both formulations differ in size and the way of fulfilling the contact constraints, thus different strategies to determine the permanently changing contact area are required. Starting from the contact potential energy, the variational formulation, the linearization and finally the matrix formulation of both methods are derived. In combination with different contact detection methods the global solution algorithm is applied to different two-dimensional examples.},

%	abstract = {Many existing algorithms for the analysis of large deformation contact problems use a so-called node-to-segment approach to discretize the contact interface between dissimilar meshes. It is well known, that this discretization strategy may lead to problems like loss of convergence or jumps in the contact forces. Additionally it is popular to use penalty methods to satisfy the contact constraints. This necessitates a user defined penalty parameter the choice of which is somehow arbitrary, problem dependent and might influence the accuracy of the analysis. In this work, a frictionless segment-to-segment contact formulation is presented that does not require any user defined parameter to handle the non-linearity of the contact conditions. The approach is based on the mortar method enforcing the compatibility condition along the contact interface in a weak integral sense. The application of dual spaces for the interpolation of the Lagrange multiplier allows for a nodal decoupling of the contact constraints. A local basis transformation in combination with a primal-dual active set strategy enables the exact enforcement of the contact constraints via prescribed incremental boundary conditions. Due to the biorthogonality condition of the basis functions the Lagrange multipliers can be locally eliminated. A static condensation leads to a reduced system of equations to be solved solely for the unknown nodal displacements. Thus the size of the system of equations remains constant during the whole calculation. The discrete Lagrange multipliers, representing the contact pressure, can be easily recovered from the displacements in a variationally consistent way. For the analysis of dynamic contact problems the proposed contact description is combined with the implicit Generalized Energy-Momentum Method. Several numerical examples illustrate the performance of the suggested contact formulation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This article deals with the continuum formulation of finite strain viscoelasticity and provides its numerical simulation with the finite element method. In particular, elastomeric solids which are of essential engineering interest are discussed. In order to simulate the significant different bulk/shear-response of polymeric media the deformation is decomposed into volumetric elastic and isochoric viscoelastic parts. The constitutive equations are presented within the context of internal variable models and a Lagrangian kinematical description is adopted throughout. For sufficiently slow processes the material responds in a rubbery elastic manner which is assumed to be modelled with an Ogden-type strain energy function well-known from rubber elasticity. The stresses and the symmetric consistent tangent moduli are briefly discussed along with a second-order approximation of the constitutive rate equation. The main thrust of this paper on the computational side is to show the meaningful time-dependent behaviour and the general applicability of the three-dimensional constitutive model. By applying assumed enhanced strain elements which are well-suited for (nearly) incompressible problems three representative numerical examples illustrate relaxation and creeping phenomena at large strains and the equilibrium finite elastic response, which is asymptotically obtained.},

  abstract  = {We present a finite element method for a class of contact-impact problems. Theoretical background and numerical implementation features are discussed. In particular, we consider the basic ideas of contact-impact, the assumptions which define the class of problems we deal with, spatial and temporal discretizations of the bodies involved, special problems concerning the contact of bodies of different dimensions, discrete impact and release conditions, and solution of the nonlinear algebraic problem. Several sample problems are presented which demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of the algorithm.},

%abstract = {Abstract The explicit finite element method is applied in this work to simulate the coupled and highly non-linear thermo-mechanical phenomena that occur during steel solidification in continuous casting processes. Variable mass scaling is used to efficiently model these processes in their natural time scale using a Lagrangian formulation. An efficient and robust local‚Äìglobal viscoplastic integration scheme (Int. J. Numer. Meth. Engng 2006; 66:1955‚Äì1989) to solve the highly temperature- and rate-dependent elastic‚Äìviscoplastic constitutive equations of solidifying steel has been implemented into the commercial software ABAQUS/Explicit (ABAQUS User Manuals v6.7. Simulia Inc., 2007) using a VUMAT subroutine. The model is first verified with a known semi-analytical solution from Weiner and Boley (J. Mech. Phys. Solids 1963; 11:145‚Äì154). It is then applied to simulate temperature and stress development in solidifying shell sections in continuous casting molds using realistic temperature-dependent properties and including the effects of ferrostatic pressure, narrow face taper, and mechanical contact. Example simulations include a fully coupled thermo-mechanical analysis of a billet-casting and thin-slab casting in a funnel mold. Explicit temperature and stress results are compared with the results of an implicit formulation and computing times are benchmarked for different problem sizes and different numbers of processor cores. The explicit formulation exhibits significant advantages for this class of contact-solidification problems, especially with large domains on the latest parallel computing platforms.

%    abstract = { This paper presents an overview on smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), which is a meshfree, particle method of Lagrangian nature. In theory, the interpolation and approximations of the SPH method and the corresponding numerical errors are analyzed. The inherent particle inconsistency has been discussed in detail. It has been demonstrated that the particle inconsistency originates from the discrete particle approximation process and is the fundamental cause for poor approximation accuracy. Some particle consistency restoring approaches have been reviewed. In application, SPH modeling of general fluid dynamics and hyperdynamics with material strength have been reviewed with emphases on (1) microfluidics and microdrop dynamics, (2) coast hydrodynamics and offshore engineering, (3) environmental and geophysical flows, (4) high-explosive detonation and explosions, (5) underwater explosions, and (6) hydrodynamics with material strength including hypervelocity impact and penetration. }

%    abstract = { This review focuses on the applications of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to incompressible or nearly incompressible flow. In the past 17 years, the range of applications has increased as researchers have realized the ability of SPH algorithms to handle complex physical problems. These include the disruption of free surfaces when a wave hits a rocky beach, multifluid problems that may involve the motion of rigid and elastic bodies, non-Newtonian fluids, virtual surgery, and chemical precipitation from fluids moving through fractured media. SPH provides a fascinating tool that has some of the properties of molecular dynamics while retaining the attributes of the macroscopic equations of continuum mechanics. }

%	abstract = {In this paper, high-order tetrahedral finite elements are employed to analyze structures and solids composed of functionally graded rubber-like materials under finite displacements, finite strains, statically applied forces and isothermal conditions. In order to do so, the following concepts are used: geometrically nonlinear analysis, Green-Lagrange strain tensor, second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor, hyperelastic constitutive relations, isoparametric solid tetrahedral finite elements of any order of approximation, and functionally graded materials. The equilibrium of the body is achieved via the Principle of the Stationary Total Potential Energy. The elements are fully integrated via Gaussian quadratures, and the resultant processing time is reduced by means of parallel techniques. To solve the nonlinear system of equations, the Newton-Raphson iterative procedure is employed. The proposed formulation is validated by benchmark problems such as: the Cook's membrane and the thick cylinder. Other interesting simulation, the Cook's block is proposed in order to evaluate high strain gradient situations. The results show that, in the context of the present study, locking-free behavior is obtained with simple mesh refinement. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

This new approach is based on positions and makes possible a robust implementation of an isoparametric solid tetrahedral that presents no locking when dealing with complex stress, strain and strain rate for general structural analysis. A consistent way to write internal variables that accounts for finite viscoelastic strains is proposed. In this alternative methodology the neo-Hookean hyperelastic law is taken into account together with the Zener viscoelastic model. The evolution law is described in terms of a rate equation involving the viscous right Cauchy-Green stretch tensor. The study is dedicated to homogeneous materials under isothermal and quasi-static conditions. The nonlinear solution procedure is performed via the Newton-Raphson iterative technique and the backward-Euler method. Four illustrative examples involving large viscoelastic strains are analyzed: uniaxial tension, simple shear, buckling of a clamped column and partially loaded block. The present formulation can reproduce creep, stress relaxation and viscoelastic rate dependent stiffening at large strains, which are usually observed in polymeric materials. Even for very complex stress, strain and strain rates the mesh refinement of the proposed methodology leads to more accurate results, avoiding general locking problems. The effect of the viscosity parameter on the material response and the evolution of viscous stretches over time are also highlighted in the results.}

%abstract = {Abstract Due to our familiarity with how fluids move and interact, as well as their complexity, plausible animation of fluidsremains a challenging problem. We present a particle interaction method for simulating fluids. The underlyingequations of fluid motion are discretized using moving particles and their interactions. The method allows simulationand modeling of mixing fluids with different physical properties, fluid interactions with stationary objects, andfluids that exhibit significant interface breakup and fragmentation. The gridless computational method is suitedfor medium scale problems since computational elements exist only where needed. The method fits well into thecurrent user interaction paradigm and allows easy user control over the desired fluid motion.},

  abstract = {Current work presents a monolithic method for the solution of fluid--structure interaction problems involving flexible structures and free-surface flows. The technique presented is based upon the utilization of a Lagrangian description for both the fluid and the structure. A linear displacement--pressure interpolation pair is used for the fluid whereas the structure utilizes a standard displacement-based formulation. A slight fluid compressibility is assumed that allows to relate the mechanical pressure to the local volume variation. The method described features a global pressure condensation which in turn enables the definition of a purely displacement-based linear system of equations. A matrix-free technique is used for the solution of such linear system, leading to an efficient implementation. The result is a robust method which allows dealing with FSI problems involving arbitrary variations in the shape of the fluid domain. The method is completely free of spurious added-mass effects.},

  abstract = {A fully three-dimensional finite-strain viscoelastic model is developed, characterized by: (i) general anisotropic response, (ii) uncoupled bulk and deviatoric response over any range of deformations, (iii) general relaxation functions, and (iv) recovery of finite elasticity for very fast or very slow processes; in particular, classical models of rubber elasticity (e.g. Mooney-Rivlin). Continuum damage mechanics is employed to develop a simple isotropic damage mechanism, which incorporates softening behavior under deformation, and leads to progressive degradation of the storage modulus in a cyclic test with increasing amplitude (Mullins' effect). A numerical integration procedure is proposed which trivially satisfies objectivity and bypasses the use of midpoint configurations. The resulting algorithm can be exactly linearized in closed form, and leads to symmetric tangent moduli. Quasi-incompressible response is accounted for within the context of a three-field variational formulation of the Hu-Washizu type. ?? 1987.},

This category of flow problems includes fluid‚Äìparticle, fluid‚Äìobject and fluid‚Äìstructure interactions; free-surface and two-fluid flows; and flows with moving mechanical components. Both classes of techniques are based on stabilized formulations. The interface-tracking techniques are based on the deforming-spatial-domain/stabilized space‚Äìtime (DSD/SST) formulation, where the mesh moves to track the interface. The interface-capturing techniques, developed primarily for free-surface and two-fluid interface flows, are formulated typically over non-moving meshes, using an advection equation in addition to the flow equations. The advection equation governs the evolution of an interface function that marks the location of the interface. We also highlight some of the methods we developed to increase the scope and accuracy of these two classes of techniques.}

  abstract = {The paper discusses the derivation and the numerical implementation of a finite strain material model for plastic anisotropy and nonlinear kinematic and isotropic hardening. The model is derived from a thermodynamic framework and is based on the multiplicative split of the deformation gradient in the context of hyperelasticity. The kinematic hardening component represents a continuum extension of the classical rheological model of Armstrong‚ÄìFrederick kinematic hardening. Introducing the so-called structure tensors as additional tensor-valued arguments, plastic anisotropy can be modelled by representing the yield surface and the plastic flow rule as functions of the structure tensors. The evolution equations are integrated by a new form of the exponential map that preserves plastic incompressibility and uses the spectral decomposition to evaluate the exponential tensor functions in closed form. Finally, the applicability of the model is demonstrated by means of simulations of several deep drawing processes and comparisons with experiments.}

%abstract = {Abstract This paper presents a mortar-based formulation for the solution of two dimensional frictional contact problems involving finite deformation and large sliding. As is widely recognized, traditional node-to-surface contact formulations have several drawbacks in solution of deformable-to-deformable contact problems, including lack of general patch test passage, degradation of spatial convergence rates, and robustness issues associated with the faceted representation of contacting surfaces. The mortar finite element method, initially proposed as a technique to join dissimilarly meshed domains, has been shown to preserve optimal convergence rates in tied contact problems (see (Discretization Methods and Iterative Solvers Based on Domain Decomposition, Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, 2001) for a recent review), and is examined here as an alternative spatial discretization method for large sliding contact. In particular, a novel description for frictional sliding conditions in large deformation mortar formulations is proposed in this work. In recent years, the mortar element method has already been successfully implemented to solve frictional contact problems with linearized kinematics (see (Int. J. Numer. Meth. Engng 1993; 36: 3451)). However, in the presence of large deformations and finite sliding, one must face difficulties associated with the definition and linearization of contact virtual work in the case where the mortar projection has a direct dependence on the tangential relative motion along the interface. In this paper, such a formulation is presented, with particular emphasis on key aspects of the linearization procedure and on the robust description of the friction kinematics. Some novel techniques are proposed to treat the non-smoothness in the contact geometry and the searching required to define mortar segments. A number of numerical examples illustrate the performance and accuracy of the proposed formulation. Copyright ¬© 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}

Moreover the consistent treatment of frictional behaviour generates non-symmetric tangent stiffness matrices due to the non-associativity of the slip phase. Other non-symmetries are due to the coupling terms and to the dependencies on various parameters that can be involved. To overcome these difficulties almost consistent techniques based on two-step algorithms have been proposed in the past. Here an augmentation technique is proposed which takes into account micro-mechanical effects, and permits the symmetrization of the tangent stiffness during frictional slip phase.}

The search for numerical efficiency hence has limited the modelling of the real physical interface behaviour. Up to now mainly simple laws, usually formulated using constant coefficients, have been available to study contact problems in uncoupled from. Here a thermomechanically coupled contact element is presented which accounts for the real microscopic shape of the surfaces, the microscopic mechanism of force transmission and heat exchange. The contact element geometrical behaviour has been put together with experimental and theoretical well founded micro-mechanical and micro-thermal laws adapted to Finite Element Method (FEM) necessities. Based on these laws the macroscopic related stiffnesses are calculated and continuously updated taking into account changes in significant parameters. The linearization of the set of equations has been obtained using a consistent technique which implies computational efficiency.}

               The fundamental assumption of all theories of plasticity‚Äîthat of time independence of the equations of state‚Äîmakes simultaneous description of the plastic and rheologic properties of a material impossible. I t is well-known that in many practical problems, the actual behaviour of a material is governed by plastic as well as by rheologic effects. It can even be said that for many important structural materials, rheologic effects are more pronounced after the plastic state has been reached. Every material shows more or less pronounced viscous properties. In some problems, the influence of viscous properties of the material may be negligible, while in others, it may be essential. Both sciences‚Äîplasticity and rheology‚Äîare concerned with the description of important mechanical properties of structural materials. Each of them has created its own methods of investigation and has developed within the framework of certain assumptions which, unfortunately, cannot always be satisfied in reality. The results of rheology are confined to cases where plastic strain is of no decisive importance.}

  abstract  = {Abstract We provide an overview of the finite element methods we developed in recent years for computation of fluid dynamics problems with moving boundaries and interfaces. This class of problems include those with free surfaces, two-fluid interfaces, fluid‚Äìobject and fluid‚Äìstructure interactions, and moving mechanical components. The methods developed can be classified into two main categories: interface-tracking and interface-capturing techniques. Both classes of techniques are based on stabilized formulations, and determination of the stabilization parameters used in these formulations is also highlighted here. The interface-tracking techniques are based on the deforming-spatial-domain/stabilized space‚Äìtime (DSD/SST) formulation, where the mesh moves to track the interface. The interface-capturing techniques were developed for two-fluid flows. They are based on the stabilized formulation, over typically nonmoving meshes, of both the flow equations and an advection equation. The advection equation governs the time-evolution of an interface function marking the interface location. We also describe some of the additional methods we developed to increase the scope and accuracy of these two classes of techniques. Among them are the enhanced-discretization interface-capturing technique (EDICT), which was developed to increase the accuracy in capturing the interface, extensions and offshoots of the EDICT, and mixed solution techniques. The overview of these techniques is supplemented by a number of numerical examples from computation of complex flow problems.}
