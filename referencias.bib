New cell-based smoothed (CS) bending strains were derived from the displacement approximations enriched by a cubic shape function for the rotations at the bubble node located at the centroid of the triangular element. The true drilling degrees of freedom of the proposed element, which is independent from user-defined coefficients, was achieved by cell-based smoothing the Allman’s membrane strains. The membrane and bending stiffness matrices were then efficiently determined by the line integration of the smoothing domains’ boundaries. The shear-locking removal MITC3+ technique was employed to interpolate the transverse shear strains. The outstanding performance of the developed 3-node triangular flat shell element, so-called the CS-MITC18+ shell element, was demonstrated through the static and free vibration analyses of several benchmark shell structures. Numerical results shown that the CS-MITC18+ flat shell element has the spatially isotropic and zero-energy mode properties, and provides competitive accuracy, convergence, and computational cost in comparison to other conventional and strain-smoothed 3-node triangular flat shell elements.}

  abstract = {A novel simulation approach based on the isogeometric analysis (IGA) and scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) is proposed in this paper for bending and buckling analyses of cylindrical shells resting on elastic foundation. The proposed formulation is derived from the 3D theory of elasticity. By using the cylinder axis as the scaling center, the cylindrical shell is reduced into 2D plane. The Non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) used in the Computer-aided Design (CAD) model are employed as the basis functions to describe the geometry and approximate the unknown fields in an isoparametric fashion. The present technique offers several major advantages over many other numerical methods, namely: only the in-plane dimension of the degenerative 2D plane required to be discretized into IGA elements, this effectively reduces the number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) and cuts down the computational costs; The physical fields along the thickness direction are described analytically, consequently the shear locking phenomena can be eliminated naturally without any special treatment; Due to the higher-order continuity and the locally supported properties of the NURBS, the present model can exactly represent arbitrary complex geometries at any level, which leads to superior accuracy and robustness; The intrinsic flexibility of the NURBS elements dramatically contributes to the excellent adaptability of the present approach on irregular meshes. Several numerical examples are carried out to evaluate the high performance of the present IGSBFEM on accuracy, efficiency and applicability.}

  abstract = {Composite curved shells are widely utilized as structural components in aerospace engineering. To inspire the potentiality of such structure, it is very necessary to well understand mechanical behaviors of composite curved shells. Compared to the composite plates, it is more difficult to predict accurately interlaminar stresses of composite curved shells. Therefore, this paper attempts to propose an alternative triangular composite shell element in terms of the Reddy-type global–local higher-order theory. In the present model, the continuity conditions of transverse shear stresses are enforced in advance to fulfill compatibility of transverse shear stresses at adjacent layers, which can improve precision of interlaminar stresses. In order to evaluate performance of the proposed shell element, several typical examples have been analyzed. Moreover, the results acquired from the present model are compared with the three-dimensional elasticity solutions and other published results. At the same time, a compression experiment of the thin-walled cylindrical grid structure is carried out to further verify the capability of the present model. These examples show that the proposed composite shell element can be used as an alternative method for static analysis of multi-layer thin and thick shell structures.}
